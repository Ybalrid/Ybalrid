### 👋

Hello, I'm Yba, I'm a C++/C# developer (that also dabble in Rust and a bunch of other things) specialized in everything regarding low level systems programming, graphics, and interacting with AR/VR/XR hardware.

I am an independant consultant and I am available for short or long term missions, do not hesitate to reach yout if my special set of skills may help you realize your projects! 😎

I am based in France but I have worked remotely with distributed team for the better part of a decade now.

I work at [@LIV](https://liv.tv) on Mixed Reality streaming software, and a bunch of other things!

In my free time, I play with some electronics, old film cameras, and I may have *too many* side projects to count them that I pick up and work on when the interest comes! 😁

I love Open-Source software, anything that runs on Linux. 

Here are a few things that interest me, and where my contributions on GitHub may be focused these days:

- OpenXR
- glTF (the file format itself and its ecosystem of tools)
- Small C++ header only libraries
- Tools that help cross-platform development
- Video game engines
- High performance networking
- Graphics API interops and IPC

Good ways to reach me, just shoot to [ybalrid@ybalrid.info](mailto:ybalrid@ybalrid.info) via email!
