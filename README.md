Hello, I'm Yba, I'm a C++/C# developer specilalized in everything regarding systems programming and XR.

I work at [@LIV](https://liv.tv) on Mixed Reality streaming software, and some new and exciting audience interaction technology!

In my free time, I play with some electronics, and I may have *too many* side projects to count them that I pick up and work when the interest comes!

I love Open-Source software, anything that runs on Linux. 

Here's a few things that interest me, and where my contributions on GitHub may be focused these days:

- OpenXR
- glTF (the file format and tools)
- small C++ header only libraries
- Tools that help cross-platform development
- video game engines

Good ways to reach me are [@Ybalrid](https://www.twitter.com/Ybalrid) on twitter, and [ybalrid@ybalrid.info](mailto:ybalrid@ybalrid.info) via email!
